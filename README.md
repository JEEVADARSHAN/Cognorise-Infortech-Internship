# Cognorise Infotech Python Internship

This repository contains the completed tasks for my internship at Cognorise Infotech. The tasks were built using Python, Tkinter for GUI, and various Python libraries. The six tasks completed are as follows:

1. **Calculator**
2. **Dice Simulator**
3. **Password Generator**
4. **Rock, Paper, Scissors**
5. **Hangman Game**
6. **Timer**

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Tkinter (for GUI)
- Random (for random number generation)
- String (for generating passwords)
- OS (for interacting with system-level operations)

## Project Tasks

### 1. Calculator
A simple GUI-based calculator built using Tkinter. It allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### 2. Dice Simulator
A fun dice simulator that generates a random number between 1 and 6, simulating the roll of a die. The GUI displays the result of each roll.

### 3. Password Generator
A password generator that creates secure, random passwords of specified length. The user can choose the password's complexity by including or excluding special characters, digits, and uppercase letters.

### 4. Rock, Paper, Scissors
A game of Rock, Paper, Scissors where the user plays against the computer. The GUI allows for easy interaction and displays the result of each round.

### 5. Hangman Game
A text-based Hangman game with a GUI interface. The user guesses letters to complete a word before running out of attempts.

### 6. Timer
A countdown timer that allows users to set a timer for a specific amount of time. Once the time is up, the program alerts the user.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/JEEVADARSHAN/Cognorise-Infortech-Internship.git
   ```
2. Install any necessary dependencies (e.g., Tkinter):
  Tkinter is usually bundled with Python, so no additional installation is needed if you have Python installed.

## Usage
Once the repository is cloned, you can run each task individually by opening the relevant Python file. Each task has its own GUI and can be interacted with through the provided interfaces.

**Example:**

To run the Calculator, navigate to the folder where the file is saved and run:
```
python calculator.py
```
